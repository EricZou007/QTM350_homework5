## Load Dataset

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### GDP per Capita Distribution

Figure shows the distribution of GDP per capita across different countries.

```{python}
#| label: fig-gdp-per-capita
#| fig-cap: "A histogram showing the distribution of GDP per capita across countries. The data highlights significant disparities between nations." 


plt.hist(df["gdp_per_capita"].dropna(), bins=30, color="blue", alpha=0.7)
plt.title("GDP per Capita Distribution")
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

Finding: most of the countries have less than $100000$ GDP per captia. 

### Inflation Rate vs GDP Growth Rate

Figure illustrates the relationship between inflation rates and GDP growth rates.

```{python}
#| label: fig-inflation-vs-gdp
#| fig-cap: "A scatter plot displaying the relationship between inflation rates and GDP growth rates."

plt.scatter(df["inflation_rate"], df["gdp_growth_rate"], color="red", alpha=0.6)
plt.title("Inflation Rate vs GDP Growth Rate")
plt.xlabel("Inflation Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("GDP Growth Rate (%)")
plt.show()
```

Finding: Some countries experience high inflation with negative GDP growth, while other countries have high inflation rate with positive GDP growth together. 

### Health Expenditure vs Life Expectancy

Figure presents a scatter plot of health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and its correlation with life expectancy.

```{python}
#| label: fig-health-vs-life 
#| fig-cap: "A scatter chart showing how life expectancy varies with health expenditure as a percentage of GDP."

plt.scatter(df["health_expenditure_gdp_share"], df["life_expectancy"], color="green", alpha=0.6)
plt.title("Health Expenditure vs Life Expectancy")
plt.xlabel("Health Expenditure (% of GDP)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.show()
```

Finding: More health expediture, more life expectency people have. 

## Summary of Findings

This part include the cross-reference to my figures above. 

1. **GDP per Capita Distribution:** The distribution of GDP per capita varies widely among countries, with some extreme outliers, as shown in Figure @fig-gdp-per-capita.
2. **Inflation Rate vs GDP Growth Rate:** There appears to be a mixed relationship between inflation and GDP growth, with no clear trend across all countries, as depicted in Figure @fig-inflation-vs-gdp.
3. **Health Expenditure vs Life Expectancy:** Countries that spend more on healthcare as a percentage of GDP tend to have higher life expectancies, indicating a positive correlation (Figure @fig-health-vs-life).

### Bar Chart of Health Expenditure vs Life Expectancy

Figure highlights the distribution of health expenditure across randomly selected five countries.


::: {.cell}
```{python}
#| label: Random_life_expectency_of_countries
#| fig-cap: "Bar chart representing health expenditure by country."


sample_countries = df.dropna(subset=["health_expenditure_gdp_share"]).sample(5)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x=sample_countries["country"], y=sample_countries["health_expenditure_gdp_share"], color="green")
plt.title("Health Expenditure vs Country (Random 5)")
plt.xlabel("Country")
plt.ylabel("Health Expenditure (% of GDP)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

### Unemployment Rate vs GDP per Capita

Figure illustrates how unemployment rates relate to GDP per capita.

::: {.cell}
This graph should hide the code and only show the graph. 
```{python, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

#| label: fig-unemployment-vs-gdp
#| fig-cap: "A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between unemployment rate and GDP per capita. Countries with lower unemployment tend to have higher GDP per capita."
#| echo: false

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df["unemployment_rate"], df["gdp_per_capita"], color="purple", alpha=0.6)
plt.title("Unemployment Rate vs GDP per Capita")
plt.xlabel("Unemployment Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("GDP per Capita")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
